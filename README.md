# NeurIPS-code
Code in Diffrax and Equinox via JAX
Contains experiment in the experiment notebook, with abstractions in the .py file.

NODE_simple.ipynb shows better MNIST classification from a given much simpler NODE (fixed 10 step Euler) at the end of the notebook

adapting code for Neural ODE from https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/examples/neural_ode/
